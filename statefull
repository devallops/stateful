Stateless Applications: Each request is independent, and state (if any) is managed externally (e.g., in a database or distributed cache). Autoscaling is straightforward because each instance operates independently.
Stateful Applications: These maintain some state information between requests (e.g., user sessions stored in memory). Scaling these applications can be challenging because the state is not automatically shared across instances.
Challenges with Stateful Applications:

When Azure Web App scales out (adds more instances), new instances do not share the in-memory state of existing instances.
A userâ€™s session might be tied to a specific instance, causing issues if a subsequent request is handled by a different instance.
